# Data art workshop

Workshop material, under development with help from workshop participants.

The main goal of the workshop is to familiarize with science and statistics concepts, by finding example toy illustrations that can be visualized and played with.

The material includes some simulated data that represents signal in high-energy particle collision experiments.

The Processing compositions examplify pixel-by-pixel analysis, and a calculation of error, that is, the total quadratic difference between a modeled image and the input image.

The task is generate an image that minimizes the error. First we look at the error given from a single image. On the second step, we try to minimize the average error, and see how it differs from the example that minimized the error for a single image. This is an illustration of the concept of "overfitting".

Example images (simulated ion collision events) can be downloaded from:

Another composition is based on Daniel Shiffman's Pointillism (available among
educational examples), with error calculation also added in. The purpose is to visualise how the image converges to the input with different rates as the size (resolution) is varied. It can be played as a game among participants, to see who can converge to the unknown input image the fastest (that is, who can tune in the resolution in an optimal way).
